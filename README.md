# ASM-x64: An x64 Assembly Playground

There are many questions and so few answers concerning writing x64 assembly, or even any type of assembly in this day and age.

## What
I want to learn more about writing actual x64, because I complain too much about C. By perhaps learning assembly, I can write better C code, and if nothing else, I'll have much less to complain about.

## Why
I thought it would be a fun party trick if I could start writing in x64 assembly. Then, I realised that there is some real-world potential to being able to debug assembly rather than write it. It would also be cool if I could optimise some of my coursework (especially those relating to performance engineering) using assembly; that way I would *definitely* be the coolest kid on the block.

## Progress Log
- 18/01/22
    - Ran up to chapter 6.0 of the textbook.
    - Learnt about file structure, data types, register types, and wrote a build script. Life is good.
